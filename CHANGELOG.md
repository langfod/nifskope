 == CHANGELOG ==

* Improved the performance of Combine Properties when a large number of texture sets is merged.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20251230

* Improvements to the Havok/Create Convex Shape spell: it can be used on nodes, and the input can be optionally simplified with [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer), and/or decomposed to multiple convex shapes with [CoACD](https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD).
* Simplify All Shapes and Reorder Blocks have been added as new options for processing multiple NIF files.
* Nodes and shapes can be transformed by mouse dragging while I (scale), O (translate XY in screen space), J (rotate XY) or K (rotate Z) is held down. Skinned meshes and undo are not supported by this feature.
* Implemented triangle selection (Shift-clicking on faces) for skinned meshes in older games that use NiTriShape with skin partitions.
* Added a new spell for selecting a different attribute of the same vertex in geometry data that uses separate arrays for each attribute.
* The Update MOPP Code spell has been reworked to use an external [NifMopp](https://github.com/fo76utils/NifMopp) tool. This allows for using the spell with 64-bit Windows builds of NifSkope and on Linux (if Wine is installed), but [NifMopp.dll](https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/blob/develop/dep/NifMopp.dll) needs to be downloaded separately.
* Selecting vertices within a single shape now preserves the attribute selection.
* Fixed vertices not being highlighted in vertex selection mode when a vertex attribute other than the position is selected.
* Fixed the Motor vectors of bhkRagdollConstraint not being calculated by Havok/A -> B.
* Fixed highlighting sub-shapes of hkPackedNiTriStripsData.
* Fixed warning on importing OBJ as collision to Skyrim and newer games, and setting the material CRC.
* Fixed rendering point selection from triangle strips on a skin partition.
* Renamed some of the fields of bhkCMSChunk to be more consistent with Havok documentation.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20251031

* The bone list in NiSkinData and BSSkin::BoneData now shows the bone names. The block should have one parent, and the bone nodes should exist in the NIF.
* File dialogs for OBJ and 3DS import and export set the default file name from the NIF path, similarly to glTF.
* The material CRC in NiTriShapeData and NiTriStripsData is shown as Skyrim Havok material, and is set on importing OBJ as collision.
* Implemented rendering the selected skin partition in BSDismemberSkinInstance and for Skyrim Special Edition.
* Havok material enumerations are sorted by name instead of numeric value.
* Transform/Copy and Transform/Paste can be used with quaternion format rotations.
* Fixed issues with closing the UV editor window due to the OpenGL context not being set correctly.
* Fixed errors on opening Fallout 4 models with a BS version greater than 130.
* Fixed the vertex position data being lost on converting a BSDynamicTriShape block to BSTriShape.
* Fixed warning on importing OBJ as collision to Oblivion and Fallout 3/New Vegas.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250824

* Added new general settings for the Havok layer and material when importing OBJ as collision. The material can be specified as the CRC32 hash (decimal or hexadecimal with a 0x prefix), or as the string name (e.g. Broken Stone), empty defaults to None. Note that some existing settings previously under NIF have been reset because they were moved to a new Import/Export tab.
* Resource file choosers can now default to the path of the last file of the same type (texture, material or mesh) selected, instead of the original path in the NIF or material, if the last selected file exists. This can be enabled in the general settings.
* glTF export improvements: support for exporting Skyrim Legendary Edition models and NiTriShape blocks, and for exporting only a selection (node or shape) instead of the entire scene.
* Added support for importing glTF binary (.glb) files.
* When importing a skinned glTF mesh, the "Flat" property is inherited by child nodes, and is limited to Starfield only.
* In the UV editor, the selection can be rotated with the mouse by Control-clicking on a selected vertex.
* New general setting for the UV editor window to stay on top.
* Fixed bugs in stitching and unstitching triangle strips, and the output is better optimized by re-stripifying the data.
* Stripify and Triangulate convert the original geometry and data blocks instead of creating new blocks. This change allows for preserving the block order and all data fields other than the strips/triangles being converted.
* Fixed highlighting the selected vertices of BSDynamicTriShape blocks.
* Fixed the sort order of bhkBallSocketConstraintChain in the Reorder Blocks spell.
* Fixed BSBlastNode, BSDamageStage, BSDebrisNode and projectile, shell casing, sighting and workshop connect points node blocks being incorrectly deleted by Remove Bogus Nodes.
* Fixed rendering the scale of bhkCompressedMeshShape, the Scale Copy field of the block (X only) now overrides the scale from parent nodes.
* Fixed glTF export not creating a scene, which causes an error in Blender 4.5.
* Fixed the sort order of the child links of NiParticleSystem in Skyrim Special Edition and newer, Data is moved to before the Skin Instance and property links. The Reorder Blocks spell also moves the data block before the parent.
* Fixed Collapse Link Arrays deleting Havok sub-shape arrays with elements of a non-link type.
* The texture clamp mode in BSEffectShaderProperty is shown as an enumeration instead of a byte value.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250630

* Added new spells to move array items up, down, or to a specific row.
* Implemented copy and paste in the UV editor. UV data is stored on the clipboard in a text format similar to OBJ files, with an additional vertex number field when copying a selection. When pasting a selection to a selection, vertex numbers are remapped, otherwise they are not changed. The paste operation currently does not support the undo/redo feature of the UV editor.
* Sanitize before save and Remove Bogus Nodes have been added as options when processing multiple NIF files.
* "Block/Convert" now sets the number of partitions on conversion from NiSkinInstance to BSDismemberSkinInstance. Note that body parts and flags are still initialized with the defaults.
* PNG format screenshots no longer use the silhouette method for alpha, the output image should be identical to DDS.
* Sliders on the lighting widget now use a page step (when moving the slider with the Page Up/Page Down keys) of a quarter of the full range.
* Fixed BSTriShape vertex positions and bitangent X being lost on changes to the full precision flag.
* Fixed Update Bounds on BSDynamicTriShape.
* Fixed rendering BSConnectPoint::Parents, the transforms of the parent nodes are now correctly applied.
* Fixed Fallout 76 translucency with image based lighting.
* Fixed Fallout 76 rendering issue where materials with the bEmitEnabled flag set but no emissive map were incorrectly glowing.
* Fixed rendering bounding volume collision used in older games like Morrowind. Collision types other than Box are still not supported.
* Fixed errors on copying and pasting certain value types like ByteColor4, HalfVector2, and others.
* Fixed selection colors on Havok constraints.
* Fixed crash on invalid or missing Fallout 76 effect materials.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250530

* The "Combine Properties" optimization spell can now be used when processing multiple NIF files.
* Implemented "Flip Normals" for BSTriShape geometry.
* New spell (Sanitize/Sort Keys) for sorting animation key groups by time. It is applicable to arrays with a type of Key or QuatKey, and a size of at least 2.
* Minor Fallout 76 shading improvements, and limited translucency rendering that currently only supports BGSM files and ignores the turbulence and thick object settings.
* Collapsing link arrays now also works on bhkListShape blocks.
* Fixed glTF import of skinned models where the bone nodes are after the meshes.
* Fixed rendering Skyrim decals.
* Fixed issue https://github.com/gavrant/nifskope/issues/8.
* Fixed bug in rendering collision where the transform of the last shape was incorrectly applied to the center of mass.
* Fixed "Texture/Choose" not being applicable to the texture paths in BSEffectShaderProperty.
* Updates for Starfield version 1.15.214.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250505

* Processing multiple NIF files supports three new spells (Remove Duplicate Vertices, Remove Unused Vertices and Optimize Indices), and recursive processing of all models under a selected folder.
* Screenshot supersampling is now saved as a setting.
* Skyrim Special Edition particle data is updated by spells that modify BSTriShape geometry.
* Fixed the "Extract Resource Files" spell not extracting compiled Starfield materials.
* Fixed rendering BSSubIndexTriShape segment selection.
* Fixed Face Normals and Smooth Normals being applicable to meshes using model space normals.
* Fixed the icons of instant spells like Flags and Color/Choose missing from the value column of Block Details.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250414

* Tangent space spells now automatically add tangents to BSTriShape if missing.
* "Color/Set All" has been implemented for BSTriShape and BSGeometry.
* Various fixes to the texture preview feature.
* Editing the vertex flags on a Skyrim SE BSTriShape with skinning updates the skin partition (fix to issue https://github.com/niftools/nifskope/issues/235).
* Fixed parsing warnings on casting tangent space spells on NiFloatData.
* Fixed BSValueNode blocks being incorrectly deleted by the Remove Bogus Nodes optimization spell.
* Fixed issues with "Havok/Pack Strips" on newer NIF versions, including warnings and incorrect scale.
* Fixed Face Normals and Smooth Normals on NiTriStripsData in Skyrim Special Edition and newer.
* Significantly improved the performance of rendering bhkNiTriStripsShape with a large number of strips per shape.
* Fixed parsing warnings on OBJ import to Fallout 3/New Vegas models.
* Fixed the OpenGL context not being correctly set by the color picker tool.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250331

* New spell for simplifying BSTriShape meshes, using [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer#simplification). It is recommended to remove duplicate vertices first before simplification. Casting the spell without a selection simplifies the whole model (experimental), and there is also a batch spell that processes each shape separately with the last used settings.
* Texture chooser dialogs show a preview and information about the selected file. The resolution of the preview can be configured in the general settings.
* Material and texture browsers have a new button to extract the selected item(s). Note that this feature does not support extracting Starfield materials.
* Added batch versions of Remove Unused Vertices, Remove Duplicate Vertices and Optimize Indices.
* Improved the performance of Remove Unused Vertices on BSTriShape geometry.
* Implemented 'Remove Duplicate Vertices' for BSTriShape geometry (skin partitions are not supported).
* Mesh spells that change the number of vertices or triangles in a BSTriShape now correctly update the data size, and it is also calculated on updating bounds.
* Fixed emissive color on Fallout 3/New Vegas meshes using BSShaderNoLightingProperty.
* Fixed the sort order of Havok action blocks in the Reorder Blocks spell.
* Fixed a rendering issue on Windows with AMD GPUs.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250316

* Implemented support for editing and saving Fallout 4 materials.
* 'Optimize/Combine Properties' now works on BSShaderTextureSet blocks.
* Added new buttons to the resource settings to add all applicable subfolders and archives under a selected folder (useful for mod collections), and to remove invalid paths and duplicates from the list.
* The 'Ignore errors on opening archives and data folders' resource setting has been changed to default to on, and multiple errors are shown with a single message box.
* Paths set by the material chooser spell use backslash characters instead of forward slashes.
* New render setting to override the skeleton root for skinned Skyrim and newer meshes. A value of -1 enables the use of the transform in node 0.
* Fixed potential link time error in particle shader, and disabled lighting on particles.
* Fixes to Oblivion and Fallout 3 parallax mapping.
* Fixed rendering NiGeomMorpherController and NiUVController animations.
* Fixed bugs in Fallout 4 grayscale to palette mapping.
* Fixed Fallout 3 specular flag and specular color not being ignored.
* Fixed errors on uncompressed files in BSA archives with full paths.
* Fixed warnings on sanitizing Fallout 3/New Vegas geometry data, and on processing bhkListShape blocks.
* Fixed rendering bone bounds to correctly reproduce (buggy) game behavior.
* Fixed drawing Oblivion tangent space when selected.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev11-20250220

* Implemented experimental glTF export and import for Skyrim: Special Edition, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. See [README\_GLTF.md](https://github.com/fo76utils/nifskope/blob/develop/README_GLTF.md) for details, and known limitations and issues.
* The 'Extract Resource Files' spell has improved support for texture paths in older games, including Oblivion normal and glow maps.
* Updating bounds has been implemented for skinned BSTriShape meshes, and 'Update All Bounds' is now applicable to Skyrim Special Edition NIFs.
* The viewport is now enabled by default on opening a new window, and not only after loading a NIF. This allows models imported to a new window to be visible, but may increase startup time, because resources need to be initialized for the default game (the default NIF version can be configured in the general settings).
* Implemented triangle selection on triangle strips, shift-clicking selects the first point of the triangle.
* Added keyboard controls for setting the light direction: F, L, T, Up, Down, Left and Right control the light source instead of the camera if Shift is held down.
* Fixed incorrect sorting of link rows.
* Fixed errors on drawing bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape.
* Fixes to Fallout 3/New Vegas rendering: depth buffer flags are now checked only on BSShaderNoLightingProperty, added support for Lighting30ShaderProperty and TallGrassShaderProperty.
* Fixes to skinned mesh rendering and glTF import.
* Fixed the light direction being reset on changes to the render settings.
* Fixed loading Fallout 76 and Starfield cube maps with legacy DDS header.
* Fixed restoring the background color after silhouette mode.
* Fixed issues with empty recent file menus (e.g. recent archive files before opening an archive).
* Improved handling of the alpha channel on DDS screenshots when the model uses alpha blending.
* Minor optimizations: faster cube map filtering, and use of SIMD data types in 'noavx' GCC and Clang builds.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20250130

* Reworked the renderer and UV editor to use OpenGL 4.2 or (on macOS) 4.1 core profile. The use of legacy (compatibility profile) functions has been removed. There is a new render setting for the size of mesh cache (vertex and element buffers), but the option to disable shaders has been removed.
* Added support for Fallout 4 and 76 Havok material types, contributed by Jonathan Ostrus.
* In object selection mode, triangles can be selected by shift-clicking. Note that this feature is not implemented yet for triangle strips.
* Antialiasing (MSAA) now defaults to 4x, and the supported number of samples can be detected in the settings.
* New render setting for the color of the grid, and the axes are highlighted with different colors (X: red, Y: green, Z: blue).
* When the up axis is set to X or Y, the environment map and light direction are now correctly rotated so that the "up" direction matches the setting.
* Flipping the view (F11) is no longer limited to the preset view directions.
* Texture rendering in the UV editor reconstructs the missing channel of BC5 normal maps, and correctly handles signed formats.
* BSTriShape and BSGeometry bone weights can now be rendered when selected, and also the bounding spheres of Starfield bones.
* Added new spell to set all vertices of the selected triangle to zero, contributed by Thomas Caron.
* The Transform/Edit spell has been changed to use a non-modal window.
* Improved rendering of bounding spheres.
* Added very limited support for Starfield skinning.
* When frontal light mode is disabled, the light direction can be controlled with Shift + mouse dragging. The sliders on the lighting widget previously used for the same purpose have been replaced by environment map rotation and glow intensity controls.
* New spell to optimize the order of triangles, using meshopt\_optimizeVertexCache().
* Stripifying triangles is implemented with meshoptimizer instead of NvTriStrip.
* Fixed issues https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/94 and https://github.com/niftools/nifskope/issues/239.
* Fixed bugs in selecting furniture markers, and setting the OpenGL context when saving screenshots.
* Various optimizations to rendering and to NIF item data structures.
* The use of Qt 6 Core5 compatibility module (previously required by the XML parser) has been removed.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20241228

* Implemented rendering bhkCylinderShape (fix to issue https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/37).
* Added a new resource setting to disable the message box that is shown if an archive or data folder cannot be opened.
* Added keyboard shortcuts to moving and deleting data paths in the resource settings.
* Exported UV layouts can be solid filled.
* Improvements to OBJ export.
* Added support for more Skyrim Havok material types that were previously unknown.
* Fixed error message on using Transform/Apply on BSTriShape geometry with full precision vertex positions.
* Fixed hang on opening loose .bto and .btr files.
* Fixed the block types NiMeshPSysData and NiMeshParticleSystem being incorrectly filtered out by 'Block/Insert'.
* Fixed bug in checking vertex attribute flags for enabling the Skyrim multilayer parallax shader.
* Fixed issue with opening data paths that contain non-ASCII characters on Windows. Note that currently the paths need to be valid in the local 8-bit code page.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20241112

* Implemented support for editing and saving Fallout 76 materials.
* New spell for browsing Starfield .mesh files, it is available when right clicking on a 'Mesh Path' item. Note that mesh paths in the format used by the base game are excluded from the file list, so the spell is only useful for browsing new meshes with human readable paths. The Update Bounds spell is automatically cast on the parent block if the path is changed.
* Internal geometry data can be saved as a single .mesh file (without converting the BSGeometry) to any path by right clicking on Mesh Data and using the 'Mesh/Save As' spell.
* The Texture/Info spell is now applicable to any string item that ends with ".dds", and it opens a dialog showing information and a preview of the texture.
* Implemented Transform/Apply for Starfield (internal geometry only).
* Starfield and Fallout 76 shading fixes.
* Experimental support for importing glTF models that use anisotropic scaling. Non-uniform scale factors are applied to the rotation matrix, so the model should be fixed manually by applying the transform and recalculating normals and tangents.
* Optimizations to the texture and material browsers, and to PBR cube map filtering and loading Radiance HDR format files.
* Fixed the 'Texture/Choose' spell being incorrectly applicable to items that are not texture paths, and the spell can now also be used on Starfield texture set items without expanding the structure.
* Fixed error on BSFaceFX and BoneModifierExtra blocks.
* Fixed incorrect cube map orientation on skinned meshes.
* Fixed warnings about missing items when using the Triangulate and Stripify mesh spells.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20241028

* Converting Starfield geometry to external mesh files can now use a custom sub-directory under 'geometries'. This can be configured in the general settings under NIF, and if the name is not empty, exported mesh paths will be in the format 'geometries/SUBDIR/SHA1.mesh', and the full hash (40 characters) will be used as the base name of the file.
* Added an experimental new spell for batch processing multiple NIF files, casting any from a selection of currently 7 spells. The files to be processed can be selected with a file dialog, and are overwritten with the modified data (it is recommended to back up the original NIFs).
* The default startup NIF version has been changed from Oblivion to Skyrim: Special Edition.
* Minor Starfield rendering improvements.
* Fixed setting the NIF version in new windows from the startup defaults.
* Fixed issue reading version 22 Fallout 76 BGEM files due to unknown new fGlassBlurScaleFactor setting.
* Fixed exporting Starfield mesh files with no meshlet data.
* Fixed loading R8G8B8A8\_SNORM format textures with legacy DDS header.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20241017

* The UV editor now allows selecting Starfield textures from all layers, and also blender masks. Textures are rendered in the editor with the UV scale, offset and wrap mode applied. The latter change is implemented for Skyrim to Fallout 76 as well, but wrap modes are not fully supported.
* Starfield texture coordinate sets can be selected in the UV editor, if the mesh has more than one and internal geometry is being used.
* Implemented support for editing and saving Starfield hair and vegetation settings. Note however that currently only hair roughness is used by the renderer.
* Starfield water settings can be saved by the "Save Edited Material..." spell.
* Added limited support for Shattered Space material paths in the Starfield material browser.
* The 'Optimize/Remove Unused Strings' spell now also removes empty strings from the string table, and replaces the string index with -1.
* Converting Starfield meshes to internal geometry on load is no longer enabled by default, due to compatibility issues with the game. Most of the mesh editing functionality and spells in NifSkope only work with the internal format, however, requiring a temporary conversion to that and re-exporting the modified meshes.
* Fixed bug in 'Show Blocks in List' mode that caused all data fields to be expanded in the block list after loading a model.
* Fixed emissive channels missing from the decal write mask in the Starfield material editor.
* Fixed issue with pasting Fallout 76 and Starfield shader property blocks, due to the block name (that determines whether an external material file is used) not being set before the block data is loaded.
* Fixed error on copying and pasting NiControllerSequence blocks.
* Fixed color correction on Fallout 76 and Starfield sRGB textures in the UV editor.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240926

* Added support for editing Starfield materials, and a new spell to save the edited material in .mat format. Water settings and global layer data are not saved yet, nor any material setting that is not shown on the user interface.
* Implemented the 'Transform/Scale Vertices' spell for Skyrim: Special Edition, Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Starfield. Note that skin partitions are currently not supported, and normals, tangent space and bounds should be updated after using this spell.
* CharacterCombine blend mode is now correctly implemented on Starfield materials as multiplicative blending, and defaults to multiplying by 1.0 if the overlay textures are missing.
* Fixed the Options/Theme menu, the list of available styles is now automatically detected, instead of using fixed Windows specific options like "Windows XP" that may no longer be supported by new versions of Qt (see https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/52).
* Updates for Starfield version 1.14.68.0. Note: as of this update, the materialsbeta.cdb file in "SFBGS007 - Main.ba2" is still version 1.13.34.0, and it cannot be loaded at the same time as the main CDB file because of incompatible class definitions. However, the DLC001 material unique to SFBGS007 can be extracted in .mat format from the ContentResources.zip archive included with the Creation Kit.
* Fixed the Remove Unused Strings spell corrupting Starfield models that contain shader property blocks with an empty name (https://github.com/niftools/nifskope/issues/254).
* Fixed bug in Copy Branch and Duplicate Branch due to Qt 6 changing the return type of QList::count().
* Fixed error on opening Fallout 76 models with NiPSysRotDampeningCtlr blocks.
* Fixed the UV editor and some of the spells not updating the view after making changes.
* Fixed crash on closing the last main window while the UV editor is open.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240912

* The Qt version used by NifSkope has been upgraded from 5.15 to 6.7. This is an experimental change and may still have issues. Note that Windows versions older than 10 are not supported by Qt 6.
* The maximum number of Starfield material layers that can be rendered has been increased from 4 to 6.
* Auto-detecting game paths in the resource settings now adds archives and the Textures and Materials folders, instead of the game data path. Loose Starfield geometries are not added automatically, since loading Data/geometries can take a long time with all base game .mesh files extracted.
* Fixes to rendering Starfield materials, and to loading and exporting .mat files.
* Fixed error on opening NIF files with a BS version of 173 that contain BSWeakReferenceNode blocks.
* Fixed the Transform/Edit spell not updating the view on changes to the translation or rotation, and for Starfield, the translation step size has also been reduced from 1.0 to 0.02.
* Fixed "unexpected change to size of loose file" error message on changes to loose Starfield .mat files, resources are now automatically closed and reloaded if such change is detected.
* Fixed error color on missing Starfield albedo textures. An empty texture path now defaults to black, but invalid textures are highlighted with the error color (if enabled).
* Fixed vertex selection being slow when the shape has a large number of vertices.
* Fixed error in the UV editor with Starfield meshes using external geometry data.
* Fixed invisible Morrowind meshes when skinning is enabled.
* Linux binary packages are now built on Ubuntu 24.04 instead of 22.04.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240825

* New render setting for the mouse wheel zoom speed in the main window and UV editor.
* Implemented the 'Startup Direction' render setting that was previously disabled.
* Skyrim and Fallout 4 shader property data is no longer moved to a sub-structure of BSLightingShaderProperty or BSEffectShaderProperty.
* Shapes with alpha blending are now considered fully transparent for the purpose of vertex selection. Note that with alpha tested materials (e.g. vegetation), clicking on a vertex will often still not work because the selection mode ignores transparency.
* Fixed the geometry of docked widgets not being restored.
* Fixed bug in vertex selection with more than 256 shapes.
* Fixed invisible Oblivion models with Mesa (and possibly other) OpenGL drivers.
* Fixed error messages on macOS about unsupported GLSL version in the shaders.
* Fixed Fallout 3 and Oblivion vertices not being highlighted in vertex selection mode.
* Various other minor bug fixes.
* Windows binaries are now also built with Clang.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240818

* Implemented high DPI scaling support for displays with higher than 1920x1080 resolution. Setting the QT\_SCALE\_FACTOR environment variable to a value other than 1.0 can be used to change the default scaling. Dynamic scale factors (due to multiple monitors with different DPI, or changing the resolution while NifSkope is running) are not supported yet.
* Added support for selecting Starfield LOD meshes in the UV editor, using the LOD slider on the main window.
* macOS binary packages are now available, built with GitHub Actions workflow contributed by DigitalBox98.
* Fixes to silhouette mode when used with Starfield models and/or cube map background enabled. Shaders also remain active for all games, this is more expensive to render, but it allows for correct transparency.
* Improved handling of transparency in PNG screenshots, the alpha channel is now calculated from a second image that is rendered in silhouette mode. The previous method of saving the alpha directly from the OpenGL framebuffer is still available with DDS format screenshots.
* When saving screenshots with transparency, the grid and axes are temporarily disabled. The skybox remains active if it was enabled, but its opacity has been changed to 0.
* PNG screenshots can be compressed, the compression level is controlled by the 'JPEG Quality' setting (0: none, 100: maximum).
* Added batch versions of the spells 'Face Normals' and 'Smooth Normals'.
* The maximum cube map resolution for image based lighting has been increased to 2048x2048. Note: this setting is generally only recommended for high resolution skyboxes with 8K HDR files, and should be used with low sample counts like 64.
* Removed support for the TGA screenshot format, as the plugin did not actually work on Windows. Instead of TGA, there is a new option to save the image as an uncompressed (ARGB32 pixel format) DDS file.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240811

* Vertex selection has been implemented for Starfield, and the maximum number of shapes supported by vertex selection has been increased from 256 to 32768 for all games.
* Fixed the 'Add Tangent Spaces and Update' spell for Starfield.
* Importing OBJ files to Skyrim SE, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 models now creates BSTriShape geometry instead of NiTriShape.
* Added support for vertex colors in exported and imported OBJ files (BSTriShape only).
* Fixes to OBJ import.
* Improvements to image based lighting (Fallout 76 and Starfield), including a new option for tone mapping Radiance HDR format images, which reduces importance sampling artifacts around strong lights.
* Disabled some of the spells for newer games where they are not implemented or should not be applicable (e.g. Fallout 4 and newer do not use triangle strips).

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240804

* Implemented the 'Remove Duplicate Vertices' spell for Starfield, and fixed warnings about missing triangle data for older games.
* Restored support for Oblivion, Fallout 3 and New Vegas shading.
* The UV editor now allows selecting Oblivion and Fallout 3/NV texture slots.
* New render setting for the number of importance samples to use at 512x512 and higher PBR cube map resolutions. The default is 1024, lower values reduce pre-filtering time at the cost of image quality.
* The view is automatically centered after importing a glTF file.
* Fixed saving screenshots in WebP, BMP and TGA formats.
* Fixed crash on double clicking block names in the block list.
* Fix to issue https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/68
* Minor optimizations in the resource manager and renderer.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240724

* Added a new spell (Material/Clone and Copy to Clipboard) that is available in the right click menu on the name of a Starfield BSLightingShaderProperty, and copies the material to the clipboard in JSON (.mat) format, but with randomly generated new resource IDs. This is useful when creating a new material using an existing one as the base.
* The 'Material/Save as New...' spell also generates new resource IDs, but it saves the material as a file instead of copying it to the clipboard. Additionally, it replaces the old material name in object names (BSComponentDB::CTName) to match the new path. **Note:** material files should be saved under 'materials' in a resource path, and the asset database needs to be cleared in NifSkope (Alt+Q) to ensure that any new or modified materials are loaded and used.
* New spell (Material/Extract All...) to extract all Starfield materials.
* Starfield NIF files are now automatically converted to internal geometry on load. This is often useful because most geometry editing functionality is not implemented for external .mesh files, but it can be disabled in the general settings under 'NIF'.
* New 'Material' spell menu for BSGeometry, BSTriShape (Fallout 4 and 76), BSLightingShaderProperty and BSEffectShaderProperty blocks, with shortcuts to material spells.
* The lighting settings can be saved as the default in the Render menu.
* Trying to edit Fallout 76 or Starfield material data loaded from external files now results in a warning message, instead of the edits being silently reverted.
* Fixed some mesh and material spells not working when cast on data fields of the parent block.
* Bug fixes in drawing the normals or tangents of a selected Starfield shape, the Starfield grid scale, and simplifying skinned meshes.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240716

* Implemented Starfield glTF import, fixes and improvements to glTF export.
* Basic material information and textures can be exported in glTF format. The resolution of the exported textures is reduced according to the mip level in the general settings, which defaults to 1 (half resolution). Setting the mip level to -1 disables texture export.
* Exporting and importing LOD meshes from/to glTF files can be disabled in the general settings under NIF.
* New spell for simplifying Starfield meshes (LOD generation), using meshopt\_simplify() from [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer). It can be configured under NIF in the general settings: the algorithm tries to reduce the triangle count to the original number multiplied by 'Target count', but not less than 'Min. triangles' per shape, while keeping error under the specified value. A target count of 0.0 and/or maximum error of 1.0 disables LOD generation for all remaining levels. Note that internal geometry is required, and that using the spell globally processes all shapes as one large mesh (this is less efficient, but preserves topology across shapes and can reduce seams).
* The 'Flip Faces', 'Flip UV', 'Prune Triangles' and 'Remove Unused Vertices' spells have been implemented for Starfield (internal geometry only). Flip UV also allows for swapping the two sets of texture coordinates.
* New render setting for using the Fallout 76 or Starfield PBR cube map as a skybox. Setting this to a negative value disables the effect, while positive numbers control the amount of blur.
* Starfield bone bounding spheres are now drawn when the 'Skin' field of a BSGeometry block is selected.
* The maximum PBR cube map resolution in the render settings has been increased to 1024x1024 (uses importance sampling at mip levels 1 and 2).

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240630

* Implemented support for Starfield BSGeometry blocks that use internal mesh data instead of .mesh files. This format allows for value editing and visualization of the data, including vertices, triangles, normals/tangents, and meshlets.
* New mesh spells for converting between external and internal Starfield geometry data.
* Face Normals, Flip Normals, Normalize, Smooth Normals and Update Tangent Space have been implemented for Starfield internal geometry.
* The 'Generate Meshlets and Update Bounds' spell updates meshes (internal geometry only) to the new version 2 format introduced by Starfield 1.11.33.0, and generates meshlets using code from [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) or [DirectXMesh](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMesh). The algorithm can be selected in the general settings.
* Update Bounds now also updates the bone bounding spheres of Starfield skinned meshes, and the bounding boxes of meshlets (version 2 and internal geometry only).
* Added new spell (Batch/Copy and Rename all Meshes) by 1OfAKindMods to copy and rename all .mesh files used by a Starfield model. Note that the spell expects a loose NIF file, if the model is from an archive, the renamed mesh files are written under the NifSkope installation directory.
* The right click menu on header strings that end with .bgsm, .bgem or .mat has a new option to browse materials. Updating the view (Alt+U) may be needed for material path changes to take effect.
* Added limited support for rendering translucent Starfield materials (thin objects only).
* Implemented support for rendering Starfield layered materials with Additive and Skin blend modes, the latter is currently interpreted as Linear.
* Fixed the contrast parameter of Starfield blenders that is inverted in the material data.
* The default height scale for Starfield parallax occlusion mapping is now 0.0 in the render settings, as height textures do not actually work in the game.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240616

* Starfield material rendering improvements, including support for layered materials with PositionContrast blend mode. CharacterCombine mode is also rendered, but it is interpreted as linear blending.
* Implemented support for Starfield detail blend mask settings, layered edge falloff and opacity component.
* Fixed mouse wheel sensitivity in walk mode and in the UV editor.
* Added render setting for Starfield parallax mapping height offset.
* The game manager no longer displays "unexpected change to size of loose file" error messages, if such change is detected, resources are now automatically closed and reloaded instead.
* Fixes to reading JSON format Starfield materials, import support, and workaround to invalid parent objects.
* Updates for Starfield version 1.12.30.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240608

* The UV editor now supports exporting Starfield .mesh files. Note: currently only the first available LOD can be edited, and to be able to render the model with the modifications, the file needs to be saved to a path where it is found by NifSkope as a resource, and the NIF reloaded (Alt+X) after closing resources (Alt+Q).
* Implemented the "Flip UV" and "Remove Unused Vertices" spells for BSTriShape geometry. Note that skinned meshes are not supported yet by the latter.
* Fixed the "Search Other Games if no match" resource setting, and the edit and browse path widgets not being enabled/disabled according to the game status.
* SizedString16 data fields are now shown and can be edited as strings.
* Anti-aliasing above 4x can be enabled on Linux by adding "Render\\General\\Antialiasing%20Limit=4" to the configuration file (NifTools/NifSkope 2.0.conf) under Settings.
* Minor Starfield rendering optimization.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240602

* Added limited (read only) Starfield support to the UV editor.
* Implemented texture slot selection in the UV editor for Fallout 3 and newer games.
* Fixed textures not being rendered in the UV editor.
* Implemented the Prune Triangles mesh spell for games using BSTriShape geometry.
* Layered emissivity settings are now shown in Starfield BSLightingShaderProperty blocks.
* The resource manager has been overhauled to allow for multiple loose NIF files to use local data paths when opened in separate windows. GameManager functions can now also be accessed from NifModel.
* Starfield rendering fixes.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240521

* The screenshot dialog now saves the image format and path selected as settings.
* Added limited support for rendering Starfield flipbooks and layered emissivity, and for the use vertex color as tint material setting. Flipbooks are currently animated only during movement, or while the M key is pressed.
* Fixed bugs in rendering ordered nodes.
* Fixed the axes not being correctly drawn depending on the OpenGL settings from the last shape.
* Fixes in the lighting only and textures disabled rendering modes.
* Fixed the hidden flag being ignored on Starfield shapes.
* Optimizations in the archive manager.
* Improvements and fixes to Starfield material support. **Note:** loading .mat files from archives is currently disabled for materials that also exist in CDB format. Base game materials can only be replaced with loose .mat files.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240505

* Updated for Starfield version 1.11.33.0.
* Added support for saving screenshots in PNG format with transparency.
* Fixed U and V scale and offset controllers on Fallout 76 effect materials.
* Fixed bug in restoring the viewport size after saving supersampled screenshots.
* Shading is no longer disabled on Starfield models when textures are turned off.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240428

* Reworked archive loading, added new file menu option to browse a game or archive folder.
* The archive browser now displays uncompressed file sizes from BA2 archives.
* Added support for version 7 and 8 BA2 archives used by the Fallout 4 next gen update.
* The glass settings added to version 21 Fallout 76 effect materials are now displayed under the material properties.
* Fixed unused BSShaderTextureSet blocks in Fallout 76 models being incorrectly added to the footer as root links.
* Fixed reading unknown fields from version 21 Fallout 76 effect materials.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240422

* Implemented the Update Bounds and Update All Bounds mesh spells for Starfield. Casting these also updates the vertex and triangle counts on meshes.
* Updating the bounds of Fallout 76 shapes now also recalculates the bounding box.
* Fixed duplicate "Update Bounds" entries in the spells menu with models from Skyrim or newer games.
* Improved bounding sphere calculation, using code from [Miniball](https://github.com/hbf/miniball) by Martin Kutz, Kaspar Fischer and Bernd Gärtner.
* Implemented rendering Starfield and Fallout 76 bounding boxes and spheres.
* Added support for reading version 21 Fallout 76 material files. The new data fields (two texture paths and an unknown byte in effect materials) are currently ignored.
* Fixed emissive multiple controller on Fallout 76 materials.
* The "Max Filepath" header field is now read as an array of unknown bytes from Starfield NIF files, to avoid converting binary data to UTF-8 on saving the model.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240412

* New spell for exporting the resource (geometry, material and texture) files used by the currently loaded model. It is available as an option in the right click menu on file paths, this extracts a single file, and in the main Spells menu to extract all resources required by the model. Note that files are extracted in the correct sub-folders (textures/, materials/, etc.) under the selected destination directory, and Starfield materials are automatically converted to JSON .mat format.
* New spell to replace all occurrences of a regular expression in resource paths that match a filter regular expression. It currently does not work on paths stored as header strings (like materials), and on abstract data loaded from external files.
* Resource settings now default to all games being enabled.
* The planar angle slider of the lighting widget can now be used in frontal light mode to rotate the environment map used by image based lighting.
* The PBR cube map resolution setting has a new maximum quality option that disables importance sampling at 512x512 resolution per face. Note: changes between the '512x512' and 'max. quality' modes may only take effect after restarting NifSkope if the texture is already cached.
* Fixed mip level calculation bug in importance sampled cube map filtering.
* Anti-aliasing is limited to a maximum of 4x on Linux to work around compatibility issues. Additionally, the calculation of sample count has been fixed so that it is set to 2, 4, 8 or 16 as displayed, instead of 1, 4, 9 or 16. The same change has also been applied to anisotropic filtering.
* Binary packages now include "noavx2" executables for better compatibility with older CPUs, including Ivy Bridge and AMD FX series.
* Fixed shader compilation error in fo4\_effectshader.frag.

#### NifSkope-2.0.dev9-20240331

Changes compared to the dev9 release from Sep 29, 2023:

* Support for rendering Starfield materials, with limitations: multiple layers are mostly unsupported, and translucency and many other advanced effects are not implemented. Materials can be loaded both from the compiled database (materialsbeta.cdb) and from loose .mat files, the latter is experimental.
* Image based lighting for Starfield and Fallout 76, can use DDS cube maps or Radiance HDR format images (available for example at [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris), place the .hdr files in textures/cubemaps/ under a folder configured as a data path) as input. The resolution of the pre-filtered cube map and the paths to the textures can be set in the render options.
* Starfield height maps are implemented using parallax occlusion mapping, with new render settings for the height scale and maximum number of steps.
* Various rendering fixes for Fallout 76, and some for older games.
* Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Starfield shaders have all been modified to use view space vectors instead of tangent space, similarly to the change described [here](https://github.com/Candoran2/nifskope/commit/7e4c6e127e3f2f569d2417bd04cbb7a6bb1bd822). Skyrim parallax mapping has been updated as well to work correctly with this change.
* Improved physically based rendering for Fallout 76 (also used for Starfield), based on the models by [Brian Karis](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf) and [Brent Burley](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2012-shading-course/burley/s2012_pbs_disney_brdf_notes_v3.pdf).
* Starfield and Fallout 76 material data loaded from external files is added as abstract data to the NIF model.
* New option in the Render menu (Alt+U) to flush cached textures, reload shaders, and update the display.
* The integer data (CRC32 of the material path) associated with Starfield materials is now recalculated on changes to the material path. Note that editing the path in the header strings may not automatically update this value and the display, use Update View (Alt+U) or toggle the grid on/off with G to force the update.
* The Edit String Index spell has a new button for browsing Starfield, Fallout 76 and Fallout 4 materials. Note: using this to swap materials leaves the previous paths as unused strings in the header, those can be cleaned up with 'Spells/Optimize/Remove Unused Strings' and then updating the view (Alt+U).
* The choose texture spell now browses all texture files available as resources, instead of the file system.
* New spell to export Starfield materials, it copies the material data from the selected BSLightingShaderProperty to the clipboard in JSON format.
* Improved lighting widget, with separate controls for the overall brightness and the intensity of directional and ambient light, and new sliders for tone mapping and the color temperature of the light source. There is also a new button for browsing the environment map (.dds or .hdr) used by Fallout 76 and Starfield image based lighting.
* Reworked resource manager, Fallout 3 and New Vegas have been merged in the resource settings to a single game mode, and removed the Archives tab. Resource data paths can now be folders (from which all archives and supported file types are loaded), single archives and loose files, and paths listed first have higher precedence. Note that a very large number of loose files may result in long load times.
* The location of the currently opened NIF file is automatically added as a temporary data path. Resources associated with the model can be in archives, or in loose files under the correct sub-directories (textures/, geometries/, etc.).
* Currently mapped resources can be released with Close Archives (Alt+Q) in the file menu. If a temporary data path is in use, only that is closed first.
* Fixed bugs in the screenshot dialog, including potential crash due to invalid memory access, and incorrect gamma on Fallout 76 and Starfield screenshots. JPEG files are also written with optimization and in progressive format, slightly reducing the file size at the same quality.
* Various other bug fixes, including to https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/51, https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/56, https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/61, https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/62, https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/64, https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/65, https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/67#issuecomment-1858428809 and https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/issues/74.

 * Non-binary registry settings are copied from older versions of nifskope,
   if a newer version of nifskope is run for the first time.
 * Some minor xml updates:
   - NiMeshPSysData fixed and simplified
   - new version 20.3.0.2 from emerge demo
   - replaced Target in NiTimeController with unknown int to cope with invalid
     pointers in nif versions <= 3.1

changes since 1.0.3:
 * XML update to fix the 'array "Constraints" much too large ... failed to load
   block number X (bhkRigidBodyT) previous block was bhkMoppBvTreeShape'
   problem.
 * Software DXT decompression for platforms that do not have the S3TC opengl
   extension such as linux with vanilla xorg drivers, so DDS textures show up
   even when S3TC extension is not supported in the driver (code ported from
   nvidia texture tools project).
 * Started adding doxygen-style documentation in some source files.
 * Added nifcache and texcache to nif file extension list (used by Empire Earth III)

changes since 1.0.2:
 * Installer
  - fixed link where user can download MSVC redistributables

changes since 1.0.1:
 * User Interface
  - another attempt at fixing the delete block crashes

changes since 1.0:
 * User Interface
  - visualize skin partitions for versions < 10.2.0.0
  - fixed \r \n issue.  (Embedded carriage returns can be added using the Shift+Enter or Alt+Enter keys.)
  - Avoid crashing when using XML Checker on 20.1 nifs with unknown file formats
  - Add ByteMatrix data type for NiPixelData
  - extra space in text editor to ensure that single line strings are nicely displayed on edit
  - Allow for multiple file filters in the file open and save dialogs.
  - Force C locale so there is at least some consistency somewhere in the app.
      Currently some editors use system locale but Qt forces C locale on some string operations.
  - Fix sync bug when using delete branch
  - Add multiline editor for text fields.  Also sets uniform row height on tree.
  - fixed display of multiline strings (without affecting the actual data)
  - syncing strip pack spell with xml

 * NIF Compatibility
  - fixes for oblivion skeleton.nif files
  - Fixes for Emerge Demo and Megami Tensei: Imagine and the NiBoneLODController and related items.
  - Fixes for the following: Loki, Guild 2, Warhammer, PCM 2007,
      1. Added skeleton PhysX blocks from copetech examples
      2. Fixed NiSortNode
      3. Fixed NiPixelData to better match file format
      4. Fixed NiBoneLODController
  - fixes for ffvt3r 10.1.0.0 nifs (capsule NiCollisionData)
  - fixed NiGeometryData for 10.1.0.0 nifs
  - Fixes for NiCollisionObject and Multiline text in nifskope.
  - number of vertices in oblivion sub shapes

changes since 0.9.8:
 * User Interface
  - Expanded help menu and renamed "Reference Browser" to "Interactive Help" and made it come up when F1 is pressed.
  - Merged autodetect buttons into a single button which looks for every supported game so you can auto-detect all our games at the same time.
  - The custom paths you've specified will no longer be deleted by the autodetect button.
  - File names displayed in the load and save box should now always have the full path and show long file names on Windows.  They should also contain back slashes instead of forward slashes.
  - Added Vertex and Triangle Selection to bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape
  - Linux file select fix
  - The BSXFlags selection box works again
  - Improved FloatEdit to accept "<float_min>" and "<float_max>".
  - Added Draw Constraints option.
  - Added check if array is even enabled to "Update Array" spell
  - Created new icons for "Follow Link" and "Flags" spells just for fun.
  - Created an icon for "Array Update" and made the spell instant, so now arrays can be updated just by clicking the icon.
  - Made the Matrix4 edit spell "instant" so that the icon would appear next to the Matrix and the user won't have to drill down into the right-click menu.
  - Created some more amusing icons for the various view toolbar buttons.
  - Reformatted the insert block menu to make a little more sense.  "Havok" instead of "BHK," grouped other Bethesda and Firaxis nodes, etc.
  - Added version matching to XML checker.
  - Changed link editing so if you clear the value and press enter, the link changes to "None."  This way the user won't have to know that "-1" has a special meaning.
  - Fixed block-matching so it works for all versions, though it won't be any faster for old versions since early rejection can't be used.
  - Fixed NiControllerSequence links so that 0x0000FFFF also counts as "empty" instead of showing up as "invalid index"
  - Added the ability to specify what NIF version the new "blank" NIF is when NifSkope starts.
  - Changed relative path specifier to './'
  - Fixed issue where links in old files weren't mapped if the file didn't load completely.
  - The XML checker window's Block choosing button now has the same new menu structure as the Block > Insert spell.


 * 3D View
  - Added ability to center the view on the selected node or shape.  Select the node/shape and press the C key.
  - Made it so you can zoom in and out by right-dragging left and right as well as up and down.
  - Added Text Rendering when "Triangles" is selected on the bhkNiTriStripsShape data.  If the top is selected all triangles are numbered if a specific one is selected then only that triangle index is shown.
  - Removed triangle sorting of alpha meshes because none of the games or official scene viewers actually seem to do this.  Improves display of Oblivion hair meshes.
  - Fixed, added, or improved several Havok Constraint visuals.
  - Added support for displaying textures in NiTextureProperty (Nif ver. 3.x)
  - Made selection lines look much less flickery by increasing the line width to 1.5 before drawing them.
  - Added visualization for old style collision boxes.  Lumped it in with "Havok" since it's the same idea as a Havok box shape.
  - A warning will appear if S3TC texture compression is not supported by the OpenGL driver.

 * Spells
  - Update Center/Radius" spell now respects CF_VOLATILE and Oblivion simple center searching methods.
  - Enhanced LimitedHingeHelper spell to every constraint
  - "Edit UV" is applicable only when there are texture coordinates present and fixed bug which could lead to crashing.
  - The Optimize > Combine Shapes spell now issues warnings when shapes don't count as matching due to the presence of unsupported NiObjects, such as NiSkinInstance.
  - The Multi Apply Mode spell is now on the "Batch" page of the spell book, and only appears in the Spell menu, never in the right-click menu.
  - Edit UV is now only applicable to NiTriShape or NiTriStrips. It didn't work for NiTriShapeData or NiTriStripsData, but would show up in the right-click menu anyway.
  - Added the ability to not stripify and pad newly created NiSkinPartition objects in the "Make Partition" spell.  Still needs more work to make proper partitions for games which require 4 bones per partion, however.

 * Import/Export
  - 3ds and OBJ import updated so that all the NiTriShapes will be attached to whatever NiNode is selected in the tree view, similar to the old right-click->Import method.
  - Added the ability to import the first mesh from an OBJ or 3DS file over the top of the selected NiTriShape object.
  - Added the ability to export starting from the specified node, or only a specific mesh, depending on what is selected.
  - Import and export now warn the user what they are about to do, based on the selection, giving them a chance to cancel the operation if it isn't what they wanted.
  - Fixed 3ds import for shapes with multiple materials.
  - Optimized 3ds import a bit so that group nodes will only be created when there is more than one material in a shape.
  - Updated Import 3ds so that it creates a "Scene Root" node which all object nodes are attached to, rather than creating a NIF file with many roots.
  - Fixed a the same bug in 3ds import as was fixed in OBJ import where "Has UV" was not being set properly.
  - Fixed OBJ and 3ds import and export so that NiImage and NiTexture are created in 3.x files, and are detected during OBJ export.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing the "Has UV" bool not to be set correctly when an OBJ file was imported.

 * NIF Compatibility
  - Added partial support for the following new games: Loki, Pro Cycling Manager, Shin Megami Tensei
  - Fixed a bug that made NifSkope fail to load the 3.3.0.13 file.
  - Fixed problem with version 3.03 conditions in the XML.  Version 3.1 files can be read again.
  - XML changes which allow NiSkinPartition objects that won't crash Morrowind and Freedom Force to be created.

 * Misc.
  - GCC build fixes.
  - Added check for empty QFileSystemWatcher, this removes the nasty qWarning
  - Uninstall now correctly removes all folders.

    instead of an integer value
    also the type column's tooltip now displays the type's description and all the
    available options

  - some small tweaks:
    - paste branch now automatically parents ninode branches to the selected ninode
    - ipc over udp ensures that new NifSkope windows are allways opened in the same
      application instance (this makes the 'new window' workaround obsolete when
      copying and pasting between nifs on windows platform)
      note that this works by opening a local udp server socket. communication on
      this socket is limited to local host only. so it shouldn't be a security issue.
