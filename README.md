Unofficial experimental WIP version of NifSkope ( 2.52.0.1 ) with Skyrim PBR support.

Includes work by jonahex for Skyrim PBR support ( https://github.com/Jonahex/nifskope/tree/SkyrimPBR ).  
Based on code from Community Shaders https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders

Multi-scatter, Twolayer/Coat and Fuzz added.
No glint or Marschner.

Tonemapping, brightness, metal specular, displacement, subsurface probably still need adjustments.

Build migrated to cmake and vcpkg. QT and qmake not required.

Best to add "ccache-4.12.3-windows-x86_64" to "external folder.  
 https://github.com/ccache/ccache/releases/download/v4.12.1/ccache-4.12.3-windows-x86_64.zip

Use `.\BuildRelease.ps1` to build.



Note: Qt6 code is brought in via vcpkg. Due due how some of the Qt6 packages are compiled building may fail from long path names.  
  Keep this repo at the start of a drive path.


Only Windows tested. Multi-platform may not work now.

# NifSkope 2.0.dev11

NifSkope is a tool for opening and editing the NetImmerse file format (NIF). NIF is used by video games such as Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3/NV/4/76, Starfield, Civilization IV, and more.

This is an experimental fork of 2.0.dev9 with many fixes and improvements, including:

* Rendering support for Starfield materials.
* Updates for file format changes in the current versions of Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Starfield.
* glTF export and import for Skyrim SE, Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Starfield. Import is limited to geometry only (no textures), and does not support Skyrim skin partitions.
* Resource (texture and material) files can be extracted, either the textures and materials used by the model, or files selected in an archive browser.
* Material and texture choosers, with texture preview.
* Support for saving screenshots with transparency in DDS or PNG format.
* Improved archive browser, all mesh archives in a game folder can be opened and browsed at once.
* Triangle selection with Shift-clicking.
* Improvements to the UV editor and lighting widget.
* Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and (with limitations) Starfield material editing.
* Shading has been implemented again for Oblivion and Fallout 3/New Vegas (it was removed in 2.0.dev7), and improved for many of the games.
* Fallout 76 and Starfield rendering can use cube maps or Radiance HDR files for image based lighting, and as background (skybox).
* Several mesh spells and OBJ import now support BSTriShape geometry, and new spells (including a mesh simplifier) have been added.
* Batch processing of multiple NIF files, with a limited selection of spells (update bounds, remove unused/duplicate vertices, etc.).
* The source code has been updated to use Qt 6 and core profile OpenGL 4, but it can still be compiled with Qt 5.15.
* DPI scaling on high resolution displays.

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/fo76utils/nifskope/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

### Download

Binary packages for Windows and Linux can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/fo76utils/nifskope/releases). The most up to date builds are automatically generated on any change to the source code, and are available as artifacts from GitHub workflows under [Actions](https://github.com/fo76utils/nifskope/actions). Note that downloading artifacts requires signing in to GitHub. Binaries have been built for CPUs with support for AVX2, or AVX and F16C (NifSkope\_noavx2.exe).

You can also download the latest official release from [niftools/nifskope](https://github.com/niftools/nifskope/releases), or development builds from [hexabits/nifskope](https://github.com/hexabits/nifskope/releases).

**Notes:**

Running NifSkope under Wayland on Linux may require setting the QT\_QPA\_PLATFORM environment variable to "xcb":

    QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ./NifSkope

The resource manager in this version of NifSkope is optimized for PCs with solid-state drives. While hard disk drives generally also work, if the number of loose resources is large, load times can be significantly shorter on an SSD when the data is not cached yet by the operating system.

#### Building from source code (Qt 6)

Compiling NifSkope requires Qt 6.4 or newer, or Qt 5.15. On Windows, [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) can be used for building. After running the MSYS2 installer, use the following commands in the MSYS2-UCRT64 shell to install required packages:

    pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qt6-base
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qt6-imageformats mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qt6-tools
    pacman -S git

Using the MSYS2-CLANG64 environment instead of UCRT64 is also supported, in this case, the **ucrt** in the package names needs to be replaced with **clang**.

All installed MSYS2 packages can be updated anytime later by running the command '**pacman -Syu**'. To download the complete NifSkope source code, use '**git clone**' as follows:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fo76utils/nifskope.git

Finally, run '**qmake6**' and then '**make**' in MSYS2-UCRT64 to build the source code (the -j 8 option sets the number of processes to run in parallel). The resulting binaries and required DLL files and resources are placed under '**release**'.

    cd nifskope
    qmake6 NifSkope.pro
    make -j 8

By default, code is generated for Intel Haswell or compatible CPUs, including the AMD Zen series or newer. Running qmake with the **noavx2=1** option reduces the requirement to Intel Ivy Bridge or AMD FX CPUs, and **nof16c=1** to Sandy Bridge. To build for even older hardware, use **noavx=1** or edit the compiler flags in NifSkope.pro.

Adding the **debug=1** option to the qmake command enables compiling a debug build of NifSkope.

##### Building from source code (Qt 5)

Compiling with Qt 5 is needed on Windows versions older than 10. The steps are similar to above, but **qt6** is replaced with **qt5** in all package names, and **qmake** should be run instead of **qmake6**.
